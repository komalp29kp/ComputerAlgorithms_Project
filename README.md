The most well, widely used, and thoroughly studied subjects in the field of graph theory is graph coloring. It has a wide range of applications and conjectures that are still under investigation by mathematicians and computer scientists all over the world.
Keywords: Graph coloring, vertex coloring, complexity, al- gorithms, edge coloring.

1	Team
My name is Komal Pawar (ID: 11512926). I am doing this project by myself with no other teammate. The contributions made to this report include choosing a topic, doing research on it, and calculating how much time is needed for each action.

2	Background
One of the earliest branches of graph theory is graph coloring. Its beginnings can be found around 1852[2]. One of the most discussed topics in graph theory is graph coloring. Both sheer theoretical interest and the possibility of real-world applications have driven new avenues[1].

3	Motivation and  Implementation
"Graph Coloring" is the subject I picked to write about. The main goal of this project is to assign colors to specific graph parts while taking certain restrictions into account. Vertex coloring is the most frequent graph coloring issue out of the three sorts of coloring forms edge coloring, face coloring, and vertex coloring[1]. Graph Coloring ensures that no two neighboring vertexes have the same color. There are few
 
types of edge coloring, vertex coloring and list coloring, map
coloring, path coloring and total coloring[2].
4	Applications
This issue has many theoretical and practical applications, some of which are as follows: 1) Scheduling: A series of tasks should be scheduled with one time window for each task. 2) It aids in register assignment. 3) Pattern matching involves determining if the elements of a given pattern are present in each sequence of tokens. 4) It aids in the planning of seating arrangements and the scheduling of sporting events.
5) conflict Resolution: A diplomatic solution to a difference of opinion between two or more people is possible via conflict resolution[1].
